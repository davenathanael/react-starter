# React Starter

This is a simple React project starter, bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) using Typescript template. This starter have some handy libraries and configurations such as:

- [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) with [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) and [twin.macro](https://github.com/ben-rogerson/twin.macro), configured to purge unused style on production build to have minimal css size
- [react-query](https://github.com/tannerlinsley/react-query) to deal with server-side data
- [zustand](https://github.com/react-spring/zustand) as the easy and simple yet powerful state management
- [react-hook-form](https://eslint.org/) to handle form inputs, validations, and errors
- [eslint](https://eslint.org/) and [prettier](https://prettier.io/)
- git pre-commit hook to lint and prettify codes with [husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) and [lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged)
